Greek Reference, under its previous title, Ancient Greek Lexicon and Syntax,
was [recommended][nytimes] by the *New York Times Sunday Book Review* in 2014.

The app currently in maintenance mode. I am not adding new features, but
I continue to maintain support for new Android releases.

## Building the App

The texts used in this app are contained in a pair of databases called
`lexicon.db` and `syntax.db`. These are generated using a simple Java program,
the [Greek Reference Database Creator][], which is included as a submodule in
this repository. The database files are zipped and placed in this project's
`assets` directory. They must be named `lexicon.zip` and `syntax.zip` in order
to work with the [SQLiteAssetHelper][Android SQLiteAssetHelper] library used to
copy them to the user's device.

If you'd like to assemble a signed APK, place your keystore in the root
directory along with a `release.properties` file containing your keystore
credentials. An example file called `release.properties.sample` is included in
the project.
